## Abstract
This repository contains the source code and datasets for the ECIR 2021 paper [Content Selection Network for Document-grounded Retrieval-based Chatbots](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08426.pdf) by Zhu et al. <br>

Grounding human-machine conversation on a document is an effective way to improve the performance of retrieval-based chatbots. However, only a part of the document content may be relevant to help select the appropriate response at a round. It is thus crucial to select the  part of document content relevant to the current conversation context. In this paper, we propose a document content selection network (CSN) to perform explicit selection of relevant document contents, and filter out the irrelevant parts. We show in experiments on two public document-grounded conversation datasets that CSN can effectively help select the relevant document contents to the conversation context, and it produces better results than the state-of-the-art approaches.
