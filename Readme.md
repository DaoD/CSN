## Abstract
This repository contains the source code and datasets for the ECIR 2021 paper Content Selection Network for Document-grounded Retrieval-based Chatbots by Zhu et al. <br>

Groundinghuman-machineconversationonadocumentisan effective way to improve the performance of the retrieval-based chatbots. Existing work on document-grounded conversation usually incorporates all the document contents, albeit with a weighting. Irrelevant contents to the current conversation context can be incorporated, leading to selecting a response that is irrelevant to the conversation context. In this paper, we propose a document content selection network (CSN) to perform ex- plicit selection of relevant document contents, and filter out the irrelevant parts. We show in experiments on two public document-grounded con- versation datasets that CSN can effectively help selecting the relevant document contents to the conversation context, and it achieves a new state-of-the-art performance.
